# Shortcuts
Notes from the docs, various YouTube videos, and Roland training sessions.

* Hold Sel for the track to show level, pan, delay, reverb values
	* Use C1-C4 to change values, freeing up knob assigns (Filter, Mod, FX knobs)
	* C1 Level, C2 Pan, C3 Delay, C4 Reverb
* Hold Shift and turn any knob to see value without changing it
	* Release shift at any angle to leave knob without have changed anything
* Func+Note turns on Arp
* Sh+Note
	* Set Key, Scale to simplify pads
		* Instead of keyboard you get next 16 notes from 1st in current octave
		* Example of C major, C2-C3 on bottom row, C3-C4 on top row
		* Pentatonic will be C2-F3 on bottom row, C3-F4 on top row
	* Chord designer type 2 (adds in more than 1+5)
		* Default is power chord, even if you choose 1-3-5
		* Sh+Note Key is used with type 2
		* ex: 1-3-5 in C major will play major triad when you press C
		* but minor triad for E, and I suspect 1-3-5-7 will use a flat 7
* Press Clip to see DAW like Clip view on pads
	* Avoids scrolling on LCD and can select multiple clips at once
	* Step buttons are clip row
	* Top pad row is current clip row, each pad is a track
	* Bottom pad row is clip row below current clip row
* Press Mute to access Cue mode
	* Depending on settings can isolate track to headphones to edit in real time
	* Can also use to mute groups of tracks
* Mute+SEL to mute track, like if you've isolate drums/bass and you are in the break
* Mute+Pad to mute specific pad during play, like kick drum
* Scatter MFX can be quick access to 2x parallel MFX
	* This could give Pocket Operator style live FX
* Note+Step adds substeps for drums up to flam
	* Chord+drum pad are triplets (and do not quantatize)
* Samples can't auto-slice after import, choose edit
	* In auto-slice click C1 to merge slices

	Levels and times
